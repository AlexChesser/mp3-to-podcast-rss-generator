# mp3-to-podcast-rss-generator
Super simple program for converting a folder of local mp3s into an RSS feed. Currently ONLY seems to work with podcast addict - for some reason google podcasts hates this and I haven't tested with an iOS device yet. Set a webserver to point to the MP3 folder and subscribe to the podcast you're hosting. Huzzah!
